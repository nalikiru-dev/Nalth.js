# Backend Integration

If you want to serve the HTML using a traditional backend (e.g. Rails, Laravel) but use Vite for serving assets, here's what you can do:

1. In your Vite config, enable `cors` and `emitManifest`:

    ```js
    // vite.config.js
    export default {
      build: {
        manifest: true
      }
    }
    ```

2. For development, inject the following in your server's HTML template (substitute `http://localhost:3000` with the local URL Vite is running at):

    ```html
    <!-- if development -->
    <script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/@vite/client"></script>
    <script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/main.js"></script>
    ```

    Also make sure the server is configured to serve static assets in the Vite working directory, otherwise assets such as images won't be loaded properly.

3. For production: after running `vite build`, a `manifest.json` file will be generated alongside other asset files. You can use this file to render links with hashed filenames (note: the syntax here is for explanation only, substitute with your server templating language):

    ```html
    <!-- if production -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/{{ manifest['style.css'].file }}">
    <script type="module" src="/assets/{{ manifest['index.js].file }}"></script>
    ```
