Scaffold the future. Securely. 🛡️🚀

create-nalth is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out Awesome Nalth for [community maintained templates](https://github.com/nalikiru-dev/awesome-nalth#templates) that include other tools or target different frameworks. You can use a tool like [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project with one of the templates.

```bash
npx degit user/project my-project
cd my-project

npm install
npm run dev
```

If the project uses `main` as the default branch, suffix the project repo with `#main`

```bash
npx degit user/project#main my-project
```
